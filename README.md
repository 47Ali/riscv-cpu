# RISC-V CPU (RV32I) â€“ Master's Dissertation Project

This repository contains my custom 32-bit RISC-V CPU implementation in Verilog as part of my master's dissertation at King's College London. The CPU is built from scratch and verified using simulation tools (Icarus Verilog & Surfer), with eventual deployment to a Basys3 FPGA board.

* [x] Control Unit
* [x] Load/Store (`lw`, `sw`)
* [x] Branch instructions
* [ ] Pipeline (optional)

## ðŸ§± Project Structure

```
riscv_cpu/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/             # All Verilog source modules
â”œâ”€â”€ testbench/       # Testbenches for each module
â”œâ”€â”€ sim/             # Run scripts and VCD waveform dumps
â”œâ”€â”€ program.mem      # Instruction memory (hex)
â””â”€â”€ README.md        # This file
```

## ðŸ§¢ Tools Used

* **VS Code** â€“ Code editor
* **Icarus Verilog** â€“ For simulation
* **Surfer** â€“ For waveform analysis
* **Vivado** â€“ For synthesis to Basys3 (coming later)

## ðŸš€ Running Tests

All module and integration tests are executed using `sim/run.sh`. Ensure
that **Icarus Verilog** and **Surfer** are installed and available in your
`PATH` before running the scripts.

```bash
# Test the program counter
bash sim/run.sh pc_tb

# Test the instruction memory
bash sim/run.sh instr_mem_tb

# Full CPU integration test
bash sim/run.sh cpu_integration_tb
```

## ðŸ§  Example Instruction Tested

```
add x5, x1, x2
```

* x1 = 10
* x2 = 15
* x5 (result) = 25 âœ…

---

## ðŸ’œ Next Steps

* Implement I-type ALU ops (`addi`, `ori`, etc.)
* Add memory and branching
* Integrate control logic
* Synthesize and deploy on FPGA
