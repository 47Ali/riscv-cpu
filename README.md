# RISC-V CPU (RV32I) â€“ Master's Dissertation Project

This repository contains my custom 32-bit RISC-V CPU implementation in Verilog as part of my master's dissertation at King's College London. The CPU is built from scratch and verified using simulation tools (Icarus Verilog & Surfer), with eventual deployment to a Basys3 FPGA board.

## ðŸ§± Project Structure

```
riscv_cpu/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/             # All Verilog source modules
â”œâ”€â”€ testbench/       # Testbenches for each module
â”œâ”€â”€ sim/             # Run scripts and VCD waveform dumps
â”œâ”€â”€ program.mem      # Instruction memory (hex)
â””â”€â”€ README.md        # This file
```

## ðŸ§¢ Tools Used

* **VS Code** â€“ Code editor
* **Icarus Verilog** â€“ For simulation
* **Surfer** â€“ For waveform analysis
* **Vivado** â€“ For synthesis to Basys3 (coming later)

## ðŸ§  Example Instruction Tested

```
add x5, x1, x2
```

* x1 = 10
* x2 = 15
* x5 (result) = 25 âœ…

## ðŸ’œ Next Steps

* Implement I-type ALU ops (`addi`, `ori`, etc.)
* Add memory and branching
* Integrate control logic
* Synthesize and deploy on FPGA
